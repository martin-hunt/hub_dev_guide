<h3>The Tool Session</h3>

<p>Tools sessions on hubs run in a container. Each&nbsp;tool session runs in the environment of the user who started the tool.&nbsp; &nbsp;Because it is in a container,&nbsp; you will not be able to see or interact with other users.</p>

<p>If you have workspace or ssh access, you can open a terminal and look around...</p>

<pre>
mmh@HUBzero:~$ w
 14:36:37 up 3 days, 22 min,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT

mmh@HUBzero:~$ ps
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
 2113 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
 2201 pts/0    00:00:00 ps

mmh@HUBzero:~$ pwd
/home/hubzero/mmh

mmh@HUBzero:~$ echo $SESSION
19245

mmh@HUBzero:~$ echo $SESSIONDIR
/home/hubzero/mmh/data/sessions/19245</pre>

<h3>Environment Variables</h3>

<p>A number of environment variables are available in a tool session.&nbsp; A few are discussed here.&nbsp; A full list can be viewed by running the &quot;env&quot; command from a terminal in the workspace tool.</p>

<p>*Note: tools are invoked by the user&#39;s account and permissions set accordingly.&nbsp; A tool can save files to a user&#39;s home directory because the tool runs as that user.</p>

<h3>SESSION=&quot;session id&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7230">
<p>This variable stores the session ID or session number that is currently active.&nbsp; It&#39;s the ID of the session you are currently using.</p>
</div>

<h3>SESSIONDIR=/home/&quot;hub hostname&quot;/&quot;username&quot;/data/sessions/&quot;session id&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7232">
<p>This variable stores the current session directory of the open tool.&nbsp; This session directory is a separate directory created for each new tool session.&nbsp; It is readable and writable by the tool and the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good place for temporary files generated by your tool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally, these temporary files should be removed when the tool no longer need them.&nbsp; Users will be prompted to remove these directories when they get low on disk space.</p>

<p>*This is the default path for a Rappture tool on invoke.</p>
</div>

<h3>RESULTSDIR=/home/&quot;hub hostname&quot;/&quot;username/data/results/&quot;session id&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7233">
<p>This variable stores the results directory located in the user&#39;s home directory.&nbsp; This is a good place to place simulation results for the user to access later.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the default directory for Jupyter tools.&nbsp; Rappture xml output files are automatically placed here.</p>

<p>*Be mindful of the user&#39;s quota limits.&nbsp;Users will be prompted to remove these directories when they get low on disk space.</p>
</div>

<h3>USER=&quot;username&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7231">
<p>This variable stores the current username of the user running the tool.</p>
</div>

<h3>PWD=/&quot;present working directory&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7234">
<p>This variable stores the present working directory.</p>
</div>

<h3>HOME=/home/&quot;hub hostname&quot;/&quot;username&quot;</h3>

<div class="doc-content" data-id="7235">
<p>This variable stores the path of the user&#39;s home directory.&nbsp; This is useful if a tool provided an option to save the user&#39;s current work. Please create a directory for the tool to save files here, to prevent cluttering the user&#39;s home directory too much.&nbsp;&nbsp; A best practice would be to create a new directory for a tool in the user&#39;s data directory.&nbsp; For example, &quot;$HOME/data/toolname&quot;.</p>
